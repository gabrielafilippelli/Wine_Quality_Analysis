 # What Questions Can We Try to Answer?
- Which factor or combination of factors affect the quality of Red Wine/White Wine?
- Do the different types of wines (red or white) have different factors affecting quality?
- Is there any interesting trends that exist in other columns besides Quality?
# Columns Description
- **Fixed Acidity**: Amount of Tartaric Acid in wine, measured in g/dm3
- **Volatile Acidity **: Amount of Acetic Acid in wine, measured in g/dm3
- **Citric Acid**: Amount of citric acid in wine in g/dm3. Contributes to crispness of wine
- **Residual Sugar**: amonunt of sugar left in wine after fermentation. Measured in in g/dm3
- **Chlorides**: amount of Sodium Cholride (salt) in wine. Measured in g/dm3
- **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: Amount of SO2 in free form. Measured in mg/dm3
- **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: Total Amount of SO2. Too much SO2 can lead to a pungent smell. SO2 acts as antioxidant and antimicrobial agent
- **Density**: Density of Wine in g/dm3
- **pH**: pH of Wine on a scale of 0-14 . 0 means highly Acidic, while 14 means highly basic
- **Sulphates**: Amount of Potassium Sulphate in wine, measured in g/dm3.Contributes to the formation of SO2
- **Alcohol**: alcohol content in wine (in terms of % volume)
- **Quality**: Wine Quality graded on a scale of 1 - 10 (Higher is better)
